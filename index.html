            <h1>About Food</h1>
            <p>Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as
                carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and
                assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.</p>

            <p>Molecular gastronomy provides chefs with cooking techniques and ingredients, but this
                discipline also
                provides new theories and methods which aid recipe design. These methods are used by chefs, foodies,
                home cooks and even mixologists worldwide to improve or design recipes.</p>

            <h2>Classic Shrimp</h2>
            <p>We can't get enough of shrimp scampi! Do we love it because it’s simple but seemingly fancy? Or because
                it’s done in 30 minutes? Or because we just can’t resist a buttery wine sauce.</p>

                seasonal ingredients that can speak for themselves. </p>
